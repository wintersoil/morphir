{-| Module to manage access to a node in the IR. This is only used to declare access levels
not to enforce them. Enforcement can be done through the helper functions
[withPublicAccess](#withPublicAccess) and [withPrivateAccess](#withPrivateAccess) but it's
up to the consumer of the API to call the righ function.
